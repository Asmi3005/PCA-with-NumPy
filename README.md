# Principal Component Analysis with NumPy

## Overview  
This project focuses on performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using NumPy to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets. PCA is a statistical technique used to simplify complex datasets by projecting them onto a smaller number of orthogonal axes, known as principal components (PCs), while retaining most of the variance in the data. By the end of this project, you'll understand how PCA works, how to implement it from scratch using NumPy, and how to visualize the results.

### Learning Objectives  
- Understand the concept and application of PCA in data analysis.  
- Learn to preprocess data for PCA, including data standardization.  
- Implement PCA using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with NumPy.  
- Visualize the results using scatter plots and explain the significance of principal components.

## Project Structure  

### 1. **Course Overview**  
This section introduces the project goals and provides an overview of the steps you’ll take to complete the PCA analysis.  

### 2. **Task 1: Introduction and Project Overview**  
- Understand the dataset and the problem at hand.  
- Get an overview of the final product you will build.  
- Familiarize yourself with the Rhyme interface.

### 3. **Task 2: Load the Data and Import Libraries**  
- Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe for analysis.  
- Import essential libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computations and visualization.  
- Explore the dataframe using `head()` and `info()` functions.

### 4. **Task 3: Visualize the Data**  
- Before proceeding with PCA, visualize the data using scatter plots with Seaborn to get a better understanding of the features.  
- Visualizations will help you observe relationships between the features.

### 5. **Task 4: Data Standardization**  
- Preprocess the input data by subtracting the mean of each feature and normalizing the values if necessary.  
- Standardizing the data ensures that features with different units or scales don't dominate the PCA.  
- This step is essential to get accurate results, as PCA gives equal weight to all features after standardization.

### 6. **Task 5: Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**  
- Understand how eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to determine the principal components.  
- Compute these using NumPy functions.  
- PCA works by finding linearly uncorrelated orthogonal axes (principal components) through eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix.

### 7. **Task 6: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
- Learn how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a computationally efficient way to perform PCA.  
- Use NumPy’s built-in function to compute SVD and break the matrix down into its constituent components.

### 8. **Task 7: Selecting Principal Components Using the Explained Variance**  
- Calculate the explained variance for each principal component.  
- Plot the cumulative explained variance against the number of principal components to determine how many components to keep.  
- Rank the components based on the variance they explain in the dataset.

### 9. **Task 8: Project Data Onto Lower-Dimensional Linear Subspace**  
- Use PCA to project the high-dimensional data onto two or three principal components.  
- Visualize the projected data on a scatter plot to see the reduced data in a lower-dimensional space.
